I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly involved with cryptocurrencies due to their environmental impact but I think the technology and the evolution around its space are interesting to study. The idea of distributed consensus may not yet have a worldwide practical application but is nevertheless an interesting achievement.
What made it interesting is the self-custodial aspect. I got interested when I read about the Emergency Kit, which is probably still a burden for most users but it&amp;rsquo;s a great step forward in usability.</description></item><item><title>2ami</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/2ami/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 00:32:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/2ami/</guid><description>Some years ago I was learning Golang and researching a 2FA tool to use in the command line (that I wanted to integrate with ULauncher, a Linux alternative to Alfred). The only tool I found was saving all secrets in a plain text file and I really wanted to avoid that.
So 2ami was born! 2ami is a small CLI tool that allows to generate 2FA tokens. Is a single binary you can run and uses your OS secure storage to store secrets.</description></item><item><title>Golang divisions</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/golang-divisions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 12:31:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/golang-divisions/</guid><description>At work today I read a piece of code in Golang that got me curious:
maxQuerySize := 500 // metricDataQueries is user provided sliceLength := len(metricDataQueries)/maxQuerySize + 1 // what&amp;#39;s the value of sliceLength? for i := 0; i &amp;lt; sliceLength; i++ { whatever } This is a simple integer division, but the result is then used as a parameter to the for loop. Integer division has a drawback, that can create a bug in this case: the remainder, as float in for loop declarations are supported only if no truncation happens when converting to int (i.</description></item><item><title>asdf, little awesome tool</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/asdf-little-awesome-tool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 23:46:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/asdf-little-awesome-tool/</guid><description>Some years ago I discovered a little tool with a huge potential. I started using it and since then it proved useful in so many ways it&amp;rsquo;s now a mandatory tool in my toolset.
This tool is asdf. asdf is a CLI tool version manager. You may already be using multiple ones (rbenv, nvm, goenv to name a few) to manage versions of programming language tooling and accessories.
Having multiple tools for this purposes creates a series of disadvantages:</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 19:25:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/hello-world/</guid><description>All stories should start from somewhere!
