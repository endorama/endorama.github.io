The only tool I found was saving all secrets in a plain text file and I really wanted to avoid that.
So 2ami was born! 2ami is a small CLI tool that allows to generate 2FA tokens. Is a single binary you can run and uses your OS secure storage to store secrets.</description></item><item><title>Golang divisions</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/golang-divisions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 12:31:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/golang-divisions/</guid><description>At work today I read a piece of code in Golang that got me curious:
maxQuerySize := 500 // metricDataQueries is user provided sliceLength := len(metricDataQueries)/maxQuerySize + 1 // what&amp;#39;s the value of sliceLength? for i := 0; i &amp;lt; sliceLength; i++ { whatever } This is a simple integer division, but the result is then used as a parameter to the for loop. Integer division has a drawback, that can create a bug in this case: the remainder, as float in for loop declarations are supported only if no truncation happens when converting to int (i.</description></item><item><title>asdf, little awesome tool</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/asdf-little-awesome-tool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 23:46:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/asdf-little-awesome-tool/</guid><description>Some years ago I discovered a little tool with a huge potential. I started using it and since then it proved useful in so many ways it&amp;rsquo;s now a mandatory tool in my toolset.
This tool is asdf. asdf is a CLI tool version manager. You may already be using multiple ones (rbenv, nvm, goenv to name a few) to manage versions of programming language tooling and accessories.
Having multiple tools for this purposes creates a series of disadvantages:</description></item><item><title>Contact me</title><link>https://endorama.dev/contact-me/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:37:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/contact-me/</guid><description>Before contacting me, please take note of the following:
