Like others before it.
Observing any piece of technology is incredibly easy.
Look at your screen, intensely.
Do it some more.
You are observing technology. If it&amp;rsquo;s on, you are observing software too.
So what now? You basically know nothing more about your system now that you did before observing it (except for, is it on ðŸ”¥?).
The reason why observing a piece of software is just a useless exercise is because observability is not an action.</description></item><item><title>Recovery metadata from pdf</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/recovery-metadata-from-pdf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:14:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/recovery-metadata-from-pdf/</guid><description>Recently a friend of mine asked my opinion on Muun, an open source Bitcoin and Lighting client.
I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly involved with cryptocurrencies due to their environmental impact but I think the technology and the evolution around its space are interesting to study. The idea of distributed consensus may not yet have a worldwide practical application but is nevertheless an interesting achievement.
What made it interesting is the self-custodial aspect. I got interested when I read about the Emergency Kit, which is probably still a burden for most users but it&amp;rsquo;s a great step forward in usability.</description></item><item><title>Making your shell scripts bulletproof</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/making-your-shell-scripts-bulletproof/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 21:13:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/making-your-shell-scripts-bulletproof/</guid><description>Writing shell scripts in BASH is something I started doing around 2008 probably, but it&amp;rsquo;s only after some years I started doing it in a way that was preventing me from shooting myself in the foot.
BASH is great and powerful, allows to harness the power of UNIX tools, but its syntax it&amp;rsquo;s unforgiving and not easy to master (and at times even after more than 10 years, confusing).
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll go through some of my mandatory patterns to add robustness to my shell scripts.</description></item><item><title>2ami</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/2ami/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 00:32:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/2ami/</guid><description>Some years ago I was learning Golang and researching a 2FA tool to use in the command line (that I wanted to integrate with ULauncher, a Linux alternative to Alfred). The only tool I found was saving all secrets in a plain text file and I really wanted to avoid that.
So 2ami was born! 2ami is a small CLI tool that allows to generate 2FA tokens. Is a single binary you can run and uses your OS secure storage to store secrets.</description></item><item><title>Golang divisions</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/golang-divisions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 12:31:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/golang-divisions/</guid><description>At work today I read a piece of code in Golang that got me curious:
maxQuerySize := 500 // metricDataQueries is user provided sliceLength := len(metricDataQueries)/maxQuerySize + 1 // what&amp;#39;s the value of sliceLength? for i := 0; i &amp;lt; sliceLength; i++ { whatever } This is a simple integer division, but the result is then used as a parameter to the for loop. Integer division has a drawback, that can create a bug in this case: the remainder, as float in for loop declarations are supported only if no truncation happens when converting to int (i.</description></item><item><title>asdf, little awesome tool</title><link>https://endorama.dev/2022/asdf-little-awesome-tool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 23:46:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/2022/asdf-little-awesome-tool/</guid><description>Some years ago I discovered a little tool with a huge potential. I started using it and since then it proved useful in so many ways it&amp;rsquo;s now a mandatory tool in my toolset.
This tool is asdf. asdf is a CLI tool version manager. You may already be using multiple ones (rbenv, nvm, goenv to name a few) to manage versions of programming language tooling and accessories.
Having multiple tools for this purposes creates a series of disadvantages:</description></item><item><title>Contact me</title><link>https://endorama.dev/contact-me/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:37:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://endorama.dev/contact-me/</guid><description>Before contacting me, please take note of the following:
