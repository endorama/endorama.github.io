As it happens frequently, I had to spin up the trusted disk analyser, Baobab and dig into it.
Something was filling up my 512GB disk, but exactly what?
My home folder Well, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t that suprising, but:
My Trash was 31.2GB! I used asdf to manage programming language interpreter/runtimes, this was taking ~30GB, 24 of them being taken by Golang installations and relative packages My code folder, where I keep all code I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking/working on, was ~24GB ⛰ Massive!</description></item></channel></rss>
