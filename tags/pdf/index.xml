I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly involved with cryptocurrencies due to their environmental impact but I think the technology and the evolution around its space are interesting to study. The idea of distributed consensus may not yet have a worldwide practical application but is nevertheless an interesting achievement.
What made it interesting is the self-custodial aspect. I got interested when I read about the Emergency Kit, which is probably still a burden for most users but it&amp;rsquo;s a great step forward in usability.</description></item></channel></rss>
