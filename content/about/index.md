ðŸ‘‹ I'm Edoardo!

I'm a software engineer based in Italy.

I'm currently working at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), the search company, as a software engineer in the Integrations team for Elastic Observability.

Before that, I've been a DevOps engineer at [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), the Open-Source electronic prototyping platform.
