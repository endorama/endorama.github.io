description: |
    DevOps is a development practice whose goal is to optimize **flow of work** from conception to **delivery**. The value of delivery lays in creating value for users, not in delivery by itself.

    DevOps practitioners will have an holystic approach to software development and software architecture, understanding that no piece can exists in isolation and the entire system contributes in providing value to the user.
