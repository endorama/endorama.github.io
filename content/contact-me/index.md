Before contacting me, please take note of the following:

<!--- Before asking for help, please do your own research first. I’m willing to help where I can, but there is no point answering already answered questions. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is great.-->
- please be polite, I’ll always be polite to you;
- if you're a recruiter I would prefer if you get in touch through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edoardotenani/), where you can also see a more detailed profile.
